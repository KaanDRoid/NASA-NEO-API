# NASA Near Earth Object (NEO) API

Welcome to the NASA Near Earth Object (NEO) API project! This project allows you to interact with NASA's NEO API to retrieve information about asteroids and comets that come close to Earth.

## Features

- Fetch data about near-Earth objects
- Retrieve detailed information including size, velocity, and distance from Earth
- Filter results based on date ranges
- Easy-to-use API client

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaanDRoid/NASA-NEO-API.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd NASA-NEO-API
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
# If using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If using conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use the API client:

```python
from neo_api_client import NEOClient

# Initialize the client with your NASA API key
client = NEOClient(api_key="YOUR_NASA_API_KEY_HERE")

# Fetch NEO data for a specific date range
neo_data = client.get_neo_data(start_date="2025-01-01", end_date="2025-01-07")

# Print the fetched data
print(neo_data)
```
